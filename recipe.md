RECIPE

STEP 1
Pre heat the oven to 220 C/ gas 7 ( 200 c for fan assisted ovens)

STEP 2
Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. They will start to splutter. It might be a good idea to open your kitchen door during this step since some fire alarms are sensitive to this.

STEP 3
Turn the hob to medium heat and add sliced onions and saute them till soft.

STEP 4
Add chopped tomatoes to this and saute till they are soft.

STEP 5
Lower the heat again, add the dry powders and saute till they release their oils and you can smell a wonderful aroma. Remove from heat. Your masala mix is ready.

STEP 6
Prepare the puff pastry sheets by first cutting the roll in half, straightening each roll and dividing each rectangular sheet of pastry in to three squares, so you get 6 squares in total. You are going to use only 4 of those sheets for this recipe.

STEP 7
Spoon the masala mix to the centre of the pastry square and place one half of a hard boiled egg on top. Fold one corner of the pastry square to the centre on top of the egg; repeat this on all four of the corners. Brush oil on top of each parcel. Repeat till you have prepared all four pastry sheets. Your egg puffs are ready to go in the oven.

STEP 8
Place your egg puffs on a baking sheet in the centre of the oven and bake for 25 - 30 minutes. Don't forget to check in between, since ovens vary and you dont want to burn your yummy puffs.

STEP 9
Your puffs are ready to eat. Serve with a hot cup of milky tea and a napkin to catch crumbs.
